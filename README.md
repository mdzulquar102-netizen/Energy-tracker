## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Each device has a predefined power rating (in Watts).  
2. When you toggle it ON, its wattage adds to the total load.  
3. Every 2 seconds, the script calculates energy used = `Power × Time`.  
4. Cost is estimated using ₹7 per kWh.  
5. Chart.js updates live to show total energy trend.
